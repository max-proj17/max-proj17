📚 **Currently**:
- Reviewing multithreading concepts.
- Contributing to the Computer Vision team in the UIowa Robotics Club [Intel RealSense Depth Mapping Script](https://github.com/roboticsatiowa/Rover/blob/dev/Computer-Vision/src/camera_test.py)

🤝 **Collaboration**: Open to collaborating on projects that enhance my understanding and application of core programming concepts.

❗ **Notes**:
- The "Embedded-Systems-Projects" repository primarily uses C and AVR Assembly. No C++ was involved.
- Work from my TRACERS position is proprietary to the University of Iowa and won't be showcased here.
