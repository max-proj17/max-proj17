### Hi there, I'm Max! 👋

🚀 I'm an undergraduate engineer working with the [TRACERS program](https://tracers.physics.uiowa.edu/), a collaboration between NASA and the University of Iowa. I also work for [Holo Reality Labs](https://www.holorealitylab.com/), a research group centered around 3D vision solutions, VR/AR Systems and human computer interaction! Check out my full [portfolio](https://max-proj17.github.io/)!

🔭 **Areas of Interest**: Embedded Systems, Computer Vision, Robotics, Control Systems, VR/AR Technology.

🛠 **Technical Skills**:
- Languages: C, C++, AVR Assembly, Python, Java, JavaScript 
- Tools: Git, ROS, Docker
  
🌟 **Achievements**:
- Secured 3rd place at the UIowa Hackathon with Dubious Studio.

🎮 **Live Projects**:
- [COQUI Fighting Game](https://coqui-fighting-game.netlify.app/) - A dynamic fighting game made with JavaScript. Player Controls: Player 1 (W, A, S, D, Space), Player 2 (ArrowKeys).

📚 **Currently**:
- Reviewing multithreading concepts.
- Migrating Dubious Studio to C++
- Creating a 6DOF Inverse Kinematics demo with knowledge from my Robotics & Automation course from Spring 2023  
- Contributing to the Computer Vision team in the UIowa Robotics Club [Intel RealSense Depth Mapping Script](https://github.com/roboticsatiowa/Rover/blob/dev/Computer-Vision/src/camera_test.py)

🤝 **Collaboration**: Open to collaborating on projects that enhance my understanding and application of core programming concepts.

❗ **Notes**:
- The "Embedded-Systems-Projects" repository primarily uses C and AVR Assembly.
- Work from my TRACERS position is proprietary to the University of Iowa and won't be showcased here.
