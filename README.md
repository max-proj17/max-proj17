- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max. I'm currently working as a undergraduate engineer for TRACERS, a NASA x University of Iowa program.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Vision, Robotics and VR/AR Technology!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reviewing multithreading and designing a robotics project to complete during the school year.
- ðŸ’¥ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that can expand and/or improve my knowledge/usage of fundamental programming concepts.

Notes: 
- The "Embedded-Systems-Projects" repository's linguist is not detetcting the languages I used correctly. No C++ was used. Only C and AVR Assembly
- No work from my TRACERS position will be here because it is the property of the University of Iowa
- The COQUI fighting game I created can be played here: https://coqui-fighting-game.netlify.app/
- Player Controls:  Player 1 (W, A, S, D, Space), Player 2 (ArrowKeys)
